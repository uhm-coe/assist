## Posts
#### Where are posts located?
You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve` in your terminal, which launches a web server (localhost) and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

#### How to add new posts?
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` (here '.ext' should be either '.md' or '.markdown') and includes the necessary front matter. An example would be `2015-01-06-awesome-post-name.markdown`.

#### Markdown and posts
All posts are written using markdown. Hence, the reason why post files have an extension of `.markdown` or `.md`. If you are not familiar with markdown, be sure to read up on the markdown basics from [github](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/).

#### Front-matter and posts
