##Introduction
This strategy document explains an collaborative approach  for developing instructional content. The process includes three stages and utilizes Google Sheets, Google Docs, and Wordpress.

###### Objective mapping of CHL-SI courses [http://go.hawaii.edu/uM](http://go.hawaii.edu/uM)

### Blueprinting
Each course has a unique layer of learning objectives that work in concert to support the more broad objectives of the program. For each learning objective at the course level, there will be related assessment items, content, and activities. The key piece is the assessment, which will inform decisions about content and activities. The content and activities support students as they gain knowledge, skills, and attitudinal qualities that prepare them for the assessment.

The course-level objectives are kept in a blueprint that visually calls out the objectives, content/activities, and assessments:

###### An example course blueprint

Beginning with the assessments, we map out the type of test objects or activities that would verify that the student has gained the desired knowledge, skills, and qualities. How do we know the student has learned what was intended? What level of complexity or cognitive skill is needed to perform the task?

###### Common activities included in content

Also included in the above sheet are activities embedded in the content, preparing the student for assessments. What practice can we give them, and which actions and creative tasks can we give them to help them build their skills?

### Content Development

From there, the course structure is transferred to a content development template in Google docs.

###### A Google doc template being fleshed out

The rough ideas in the blueprint are fleshed out and recieve several periods of review. As it is finalized at the 25% and 100% milestones, content is migrated into the Wordpress course site.

### Finishing and publishing

###### The WP visual editor of an example course page

###### The live, polished version of a WP course site

Changes to the course content are made in WP from then on, during instruction and maintenance periods.
