1. Begin by logging in and navigating to the Laulima course site that you would like to upload the resource to.

    ![]({{ site.pathname }}/img/2016-01-11-upload-a-resource-to-a-laulima-course/image01.png)

2. Select **Resources** from the left-hand column of options in the Laulima course site.

3. Locate the folder inside Resources that you would like to add a file to, then click **Add** and then **Upload Files** from the dropdown menu.

4. Click **Choose file** and browse to the file on your local computer that you would like to upload. If you would like to assign a different name to the file, enter it in the **Display name** field.

5. Finally, select the notification you would like to be sent to all members of the Laulima site - or do nothing if you do not wish to send a notification about the new Resource file. The file will now appear in the **Resources** section of your Laulima site.

    Tip: Don’t see the resource you attempted to upload to the Laulima course site? Navigate to the Resources section of the course site and scroll through the list of items there. It’s possible that the resource was uploaded to a specific folder inside Resources instead of the root (base) folder.
