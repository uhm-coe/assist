    Tip: The number in parentheses indicates the number of questions in the question pool. Use this number to determine the number of questions you would like to draw from the question pool.

6. Enter the number of questions you want to draw from the question pool. You can optionally enter a value in the **Point value of questions and Negative point value for the incorrect answer selection** fields.

    Tip: If you choose **A studentʻs questions are randomized each time an assessment is submitted**, your studentʻs questions will be randomized each time he or she restarts the same assessment.
