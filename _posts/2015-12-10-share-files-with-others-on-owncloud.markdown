1. Begin by clicking on the ownCloud icon and selecting **Open ownCloud in browser**.

    ![]({{ site.pathname }}/img/2015-12-10-share-files-with-others-on-owncloud/image03.png)

2. Locate the file you want to share, then hover your mouse over the file and click on **Share**.

3. Enter the name of the COE member or COE group you would like to share the file with. The name of the person or group should populate as you type.

4. Choose the sharing access level (can share, can edit) by checking the appropriate sharing boxes.

    Tip: When sharing a folder, you can allow shared users to add and delete files or folders within the shared folder by checking the ‘can edit’ box.

5. To verify that you have shared your file, click on **Shared with others** tab.

    ![]({{ site.pathname }}/img/2015-12-10-share-files-with-others-on-owncloud/image05.png)

6. You can also share folders to others the same way you share a file.

    ![]({{ site.pathname }}/img/2015-12-10-share-files-with-others-on-owncloud/image01.png)

    Tip: It is recommended that you uncheck the delete box to prevent anyone from accidentally deleting your shared folder. Click on the black triangle to expand and view the delete box.
