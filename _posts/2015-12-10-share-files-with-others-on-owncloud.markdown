*Tip: When sharing a folder, you can allow shared users to add and delete files or folders within the shared folder by checking the ‘can edit’ box.*

5. To verify that you have shared your file, click on **Shared with others** tab.

6. You can also share folders to others the same way you share a file.

*Tip: It is recommended that you uncheck the delete box to prevent anyone from accidentally deleting your shared folder. Click on the black triangle to expand and view the delete box.*
