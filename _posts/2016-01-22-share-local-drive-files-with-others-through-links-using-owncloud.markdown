2. Locate the file you would like to share and right-click on the file, then selecting **Share with ownCloud**.

4. You can optionally set a password protect and expiration date to protect your files.

    Tip: If you are sharing a document that contain sensitive information or personal identifiable information (PII), we recommend using one or both of these options.

    Tip: You can also share entire folders via a link. See Share Folders With Others Through Links Using ownCloud.

6. You can paste your copied link to an email message, Google doc or anywhere you would like the link to be available.
