###Install the Necessary Laulima Tools
In order for you to copy content from the dev site to your live course site, you will need to install the same Laulima tools that were used in the dev site.

1. Begin by logging into the Laulima dev site you will be copying the content from.

    Tip:  Make sure that the dev site department code and course number (ex. ITE 320) matches the department code and course number of the course site you will be teaching.


2. Open a new browser window and open the Laulima course site you will be copying the content to. Resize both browser windows and arrange them side by side.

    Tip: By putting the dev and the live course site side by side, you can easily match and edit the tools you need to successfully copy the content from the dev site.

3. Click on **Site Info** for both dev and course sites.

4. Click on **Edit Tools** for both dev and course sites.

5. Compare the tools on your course site with the dev site. You will need to add tools that you are missing in your course site. On your course site, click (or unclick) on the checkboxes for the corresponding tools you are adding (or removing) until it matches the dev site.

6. Donâ€™t be concerned about web content tools at this point. They will be transferred in the later steps.
