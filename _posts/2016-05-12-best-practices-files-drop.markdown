###Introduction
The Files Drop feature in ownCloud that allows anyone to upload files with the click of a button to the directory of your choosing, without needing a login, and they cannot see or change the contents of the directory. It is the perfect replacement for attaching large files to email, maintaining an FTP server, and commercial file-sharing services.

###Setting up Files Drop
To get started with Files Drop, you must [enable and setup the Files Drop feature in ownCloud](https://assist.coe.hawaii.edu/how-to/2016/05/08/set-up-files-drop-in-owncloud.html)

###Instructions to Users
When giving out your Files Drop link for users to upload, we recommend providing the following guideline information to avoid common issues:

####Be aware of the file size limit (max 1 GB)

####Use a file naming convention (examples below)
- For student assignment or assessment submissions: "LastName_FirstName_AssignmentName"
- For application or form submissions: "LastName_FirstInitial_FormName"
- For more information on file naming conventions, see [Folder and File Name Convention - 10 Rules for Best Practice](http://www.exadox.com/en/articles/file-naming-convention-ten-rules-best-practice)

####Be aware of the acceptable file types (PDF, Excel, Word, PowerPoint)

Here is a [generic template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zuWZTbm8BAus1QrOBUnTROZ_elOQpsCGESkNJPybCas/edit) you can use and distribute to users.

###Managing Incoming Files
Please be aware that if you are expecting incoming files from many users, you may need to manage the files you receive. We highly recommend sorting and/or removing older files on a periodic basis depending on the amount of files sent to you via Files Drop (daily, weekly, or monthly, usually at the end of business day).
