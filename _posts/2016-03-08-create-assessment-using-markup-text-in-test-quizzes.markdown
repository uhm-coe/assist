1. Before you import your questions, make sure that your questions are in the format as shown in screenshot.

    Tip: Editing the questions is easier on a text editor due to Word and Google Docâ€™s automatic ordered list formatting of numbers of letters with unnecessary spacing. Simply, copy all of your questions from Word or Google Doc and paste to Text Edit (Mac) or Notepad (Windows).

2. Navigate to the Laulima course site you will be creating the assessment in, then click on **Test & Quizzes**.

3. Name your assessment in the **Assessment Title** field. Make sure the **Create using markup text** option is selected. Click **Create**.
