1. Open Firefox and click on your instructor's virtual office (vOffice) or use this [test room](<http://tinyurl.com/clairesvoffice>). If you can successfully get into the BBC practice room, you already have the launcher and do not need to go through the following steps. If you do not have the launcher installed, when you click on a BCC virtual office link you will come to this page in Firefox.* Click Download.

    Tip: If you know you have the launcher installed and are still prompted to download it (like picture above), click on “Launch Blackboard Collaborate now” below the Download button

2. Once it finishes downloading, click on the Firefox Downloads arrow (in top right corner) and click on the launcher file to install it.

3. Click on Run. This is a large file, the download may take a moment.

4. Go through the Installation Wizard to install the Blackboard Collaborate Launcher. This is a one-time setup process.

That’s it!

The launcher is now installed and the process of entering a BBC virtual office will now begin.  You should not need to install the launcher again.

Now, refer to the instructions on joining a BBC session using the links for Joining a Session.  The process of joining a session will happen EVERY time you join a BBC session.  Installing the launcher was a one-time process.
