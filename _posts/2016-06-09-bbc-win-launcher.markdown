1. Open Firefox and click on your instructor's virtual office (vOffice) or use this [test room](<http://tinyurl.com/uh-bbc>). If you can successfully get into your instructorʻs or the test vOffice, you already have the launcher and do not need to go through the following steps.

    Tip: If you know you have the launcher installed and are still prompted to download it (like the picture above), click on “Launch Blackboard Collaborate now” below the Download button

2. Once it finishes downloading, click on the Firefox Downloads arrow (in top right corner) and click on the launcher file to install it.

3. Click on Run. This is a large file and may take a while to download.

4. Go through the Installation Wizard to install the Blackboard Collaborate Launcher. This is a one-time setup process.

**That’s it!** The launcher is now installed and the process of entering a BbC virtual office will now begin.  You should not need to install the launcher again.

The process of joining a session will happen each time you join a BbC session, but installing the launcher is a one-time process.

Refer to the instructions on joining a BbC session by [clicking here](https://assist.coe.hawaii.edu/how-to/2016/06/13/bbc-win-join.html).
