###Introduction
ownCloud is a simple tool for syncing your files to the College of Education (COE) secure cloud-based file storage system. On your COE computer or device, you will have access to our secure COE ownCloud server using the ownCloud sync client, web browser or mobile app.

###Why Use ownCloud?
ownCloud is the COE supported method to safely store, backup and share files - especially those containing sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII).

###Before You Get started
In order to set up your COE computer to ownCloud, make sure that your computer is encrypted. If you arenâ€™t sure, you can check with COE tech support located in Wist Hall 134. Please note that if your computer is not encrypted, the encryption process may take as long as a few days depending on your hard drive. Once encrypted, COE tech support can install your ownCloud client.

###Mobile app
With the ownCloud mobile app, you can:

- Have secure access to your ownCloud files
- View your files without downloading
- Take your files with you on the go

You will need to install and setup the ownCloud mobile app ($0.99 for both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.owncloud.android) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/owncloud/id543672169?ls=1&mt=8) versions) before you can view your files. We recommend setting an appointment with [COE tech support](mailto:coetech@hawaii.edu) to make sure you successfully install the ownCloud mobile app and securely access your ownCloud files.
