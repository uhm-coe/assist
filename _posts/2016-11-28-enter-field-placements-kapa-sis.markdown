This tutorial assumes you have access to SIS. If you do not have access, please contact Adam at [itega@hawaii.edu](itega@hawaii.edu).

The following is a visual tutorial for the new SIS system. Please know that this system is new and is still being continually developed, so there may be bugs and other such issues present.

**Note:** Some buttons and selections seen in this tutorial may or may not be present in your view of the screen.

You may find ‘Note’ throughout this tutorial noting some things you may have to work around. Thank you for your patience. We will update this tutorial whenever there are new changes/updates to the interface.

### SIS Login Page
Login into SIS with your UH username and password at [the SIS Login Page](https://sis.coe.hawaii.edu/kapa/user_session/new). Please bookmark for future reference.

To begin entering/editing placement data for a teacher candidate, click on the number shown under the Placements column, which will show:

- 0 if no placement data has been entered and saved yet
- 1, 2, 3, etc. representing all saved placements to date for this student this semester

**Note**: Please be aware that a new tab will open when you click on the number.


### Student’s Overview
This screen shows everything in SIS concerning the student. Move down to the expanded *Placements sub-section*.

By default, you must create the initial placement for each of your candidates; click the *New* Placement button at the top right of the sub-section to do so.
