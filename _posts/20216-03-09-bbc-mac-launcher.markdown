1. Open Firefox and click on your instructor's virtual office (vOffice) or use this [test room](<http://tinyurl.com/clairesvoffice>). If you can successfully get into the BBC practice room, you already have the launcher and do not need to go through the following steps.

    Tip: If you know you have the launcher installed and are still prompted to download it (like picture above), click on “Launch Blackboard Collaborate now” below the Download button

2. After you click Download, Save the file.

3. This is a large file, the download may take a moment. Once it finishes downloading, click on the Firefox Downloads arrow (in top right corner) and click on the name of the downloaded file to open it. The process of joining a session will happen EVERY time you join a BBC session. Installing the launcher was a one-time process.

4. **That’s it!** The launcher is now installed and the process of entering the vOffice will now begin.
