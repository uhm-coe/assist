#### Introduction
Below are the steps for signing into a Blackboard Collaborate session. You’ll need to have the Blackboard Collaborate Launcher downloaded first in order to open the meeting file. If you have not already downloaded it, please refer to the tutorial titled, "Installing Blackboard Collaborate Launcher for Windows" by [clicking here](<https://assist.coe.hawaii.edu/how-to/2016/06/09/bbc-win-launcher.html>).

1. Use your instructorʻs link or this [test room](<http://tinyurl.com/uh-bbc>) in Firefox, commonly referred to as Blackboard Collaborate (**BbC**) virtual office (**vOffice**). If you are using a headset, plug it in before launching the session. Enter your name as you wish it to appear in the session (we suggest using both your first and last name). Click on **Log In**.

2. Once you click on **Log In**, a file called meeting.collab will download and Firefox will ask what you would like to do with this file. Select **Open with Blackboard Collaborate Launcher** (default). Check the box next to **Do this automatically for files like this from now on** and select **OK**.

3. Depending on your computer’s security settings, a Firewall window will appear. Please check **Private networks** if you are on a secure personal computer; otherwise, choose **Public networks**. Select **Allow Access** to answer in the affirmative.

6. Wait for the session to load. The loading process should take no more than 3 minutes. Clicking multiple times to force Blackboard Collaborate to open will give you an error message. Should you receive an error message, close out of Firefox and restart the process again. If you encounter the same error, restart your computer and try again.

A friendly reminder that each faculty who uses Blackboard Collaborate has their own vOffice link.
